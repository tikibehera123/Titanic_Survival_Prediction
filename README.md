## Overview

This application walks users through the process of predicting Titanic passenger survival using two different machine learning models: Linear Regression and Decision Trees. The project serves as an educational tool to understand key concepts in data science and machine learning.


## Features

### 1. Data Exploration
- Interactive visualizations of the Titanic dataset
- Insights into passenger demographics and survival rates
- Key patterns and correlations displayed through charts and statistics

### 2. Interactive Model Training Process
- Step-by-step walkthrough of the machine learning pipeline
- Visual representation of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training
- Python code snippets for each stage of the process
- Real-time progress tracking

### 3. Model Comparison & Results
- Side-by-side comparison of Linear Regression and Decision Tree models
- Performance metrics visualization (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC)
- Feature importance analysis for both models
- Interactive charts for comparing model performance

## Technical Implementation

This project is built with:

- **React** - Frontend JavaScript library
- **TypeScript** - Static typing for JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **shadcn-ui** - Component library for modern web applications
- **Recharts** - Charting library for visualizing model performance
- **Vite** - Build tool and development server

## Learning Objectives

Users of this application will learn:

- How to approach a classification problem in machine learning
- The importance of data cleaning and feature engineering
- How different models (linear vs. non-linear) approach the same problem
- How to interpret and compare model performance metrics
- The strengths and weaknesses of using Linear Regression for classification tasks
- How Decision Trees capture non-linear relationships in data

## Project Structure

- **Data Exploration Section** - Visualizes key aspects of the Titanic dataset
- **Model Training Section** - Interactive step-by-step walkthrough of the ML process
- **Model Comparison Section** - Detailed analysis of model performance and feature importance
